### Introduction

If you are already familiar with [finite
automata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), then
understanding a [Markov
chain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) will not be as hard.
If you are not familiar with one, you can think of finite automata as a
[flowchart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart), with states and
paths leading from one state to another [based on some decision being
made](http://xkcd.com/627/). An example could be a room with a light
switch; there are the two states of having the light on or off. Using
the light switch will transition you between the two states.

The difference between standard finite automata and Markov chains is
that instead of having some definite outcome determining each path (eg.
yes or no), they are probabilities. Take for example a coin flip, there
is a 50% (0.5) chance that it could either be heads or tails.

### An Example

Let\'s explore Markov chains a little deeper with respect to natural
languages and take a look at some sample text that will form the
[corpus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus) of our analysis.

"I like turtles. I like rabbits. I don\'t like snails."

This would render a Markov chain as follows:

::: {.separator style="clear: both; text-align: center;"}
[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U2fyhOJ7bN8/UJsL23oh3zI/AAAAAAAADRs/wZNWvVR-Jco/s400/text-markov.png){width="400"
height="345"}](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U2fyhOJ7bN8/UJsL23oh3zI/AAAAAAAADRs/wZNWvVR-Jco/s1600/text-markov.png)
:::

The above chain means that, among the sentences:

-   100% (1.0) will start with *I*.
-   This will be followed by *like* for 66% (0.66) of the time and
    *don\'t* for 33% (0.33) of the time.
-   The word *don\'t* will always (100% / 1.0) be followed by *like*.
-   Then lastly, *turtles*, *rabbits* and *snails* will all follow
    *like* 33% (0.33) of the time.

The nice thing about Markov chains, with respect to natural language
modelling, is that they form [word
dependencies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar) without
any knowledge of the language\'s syntax or semantics. The chain gets
created purely based on statistical knowledge extracted from the corpus.

### Text Generation

Random Selection
----------------

Using the Markov chain example from before and taking the weight of
probabilities into account, we can randomly traverse the chain to
generate new sentences like:

"I don\'t like turtles. I like snails."

Although, our small corpus does not make for very interesting or new
text. We could make it more interesting by adding to it or switching to
a much larger corpus altogether. In my case, I decided to take all of
[Shakespear\'s
sonnets](https://raw.github.com/awalsh128/nlp/master/sonnets.txt) and
generate the text from that. You can see some example code that uses it
as the corpus below.

The Code
--------

The Markov chains will be built up for each new sentence it comes
across. The critical parts to the `MarkovChain` object are its:

-   **Cardinalities**: The cardinality of the sample space for a given
    state. In our original example, the cardinality of *like* is 3 since
    snails, rabbits and turtles follow out of the *like* state. The
    cardinality of *I* would be 2 since *don\'t* and *like* follow.
-   **Occurrences**: The edge valued occurrences between the different
    states. For example, a transition from the *I* to *like* state
    occurred twice. The probability can then be easily calculated by
    taking the number of occurrences on a transition and divide it by
    the cardinality of the state\'s sample space. Note, there is also a
    special start state transition that can be used at the beginning of
    each new sentence generation.

Using these two parts, a random walk can be made across a chain path,
starting from the special start state. Each walk will generate a new
sentence based on probabilities of the transitions along the path.
