I made the stupid mistake of importing an Eclipse project into my
workspace when theÂ [import location was from the workspace
itself](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=279781). I went to
delete the recursive folder when I encountered an error that the file
path name was too long to delete.\
\
The [best manual
solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/236533/how-do-you-automate-copying-file-with-path-too-deep-issues-in-windows)
that I found was to go as deep as possible in the recursive folder and
then map it to a virtual drive.\
[\
]{.Apple-style-span
style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"}\
[subst x: c:\\recursiveFolder\\]{.Apple-style-span
style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"}[recursiveFolder\\]{.Apple-style-span
style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"}[recursiveFolder\\\...]{.Apple-style-span
style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"}\
[\
]{.Apple-style-span style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[This can be quite an arduous process; I found myself creating up to 9
virtual drives. It eventually worked though and I was able to delete the
recursive folder.]{.Apple-style-span style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
]{.Apple-style-span style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[I also [found a
site](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Recursive_Directory_Bug_in_Eclipse_Project_Import)
with a Perl script that deletes long file paths but haven\'t tested it
myself.]{.Apple-style-span style="font-family: inherit;"}
