### Introduction & Scope

The PCAP-NG file format is used to store network captured data used by
great programs like [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html).
There are several API\'s available for both
[Linux](http://www.tcpdump.org/) and [Windows](http://www.winpcap.org/)
but none that are ported to .NET. I decided to [make
one](https://github.com/awalsh128/PcapngFile/) for my own use in
building a network traffic replay agent.

This code demonstrates an approach to reading in PCAP-NG files. Most of
the time I was concerned with the [enhanced packet block
type](http://www.winpcap.org/ntar/draft/PCAP-DumpFileFormat.html#sectionepb)
since it stored the TCP payloads I wanted to replay.

### Design Considerations

All block types derive from a common abstract class (BlockBase). This is
useful when you need a collection of blocks with different subtypes, as
in the second code segments below. Internally, all classes populate
themselves from the underlying binary reader.

The reader class can be used to iterate over a single block type.

``` csharp
var reader = new PcapngFile.Reader("test.pcapng");   
foreach (var packet in reader.EnhancedPackets)
{
   byte[] payload = packet.Data;
}
```

\... or all of them, cast into their parent type.

``` csharp
var blocks = new List<PcapngFile.BlockBase>();
while (reader.PeekStoreType() != PcapngFile.BlockType.None)
{
   blocks.Add(reader.ReadBlock());
}
```

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to leave a comment. I
also have the assembly available via NuGet
[here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PcapngFile/1.0.1).
