Some computer based reading I have enjoyed over the years.

## Computer Science

* [Art of Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Programming-Volumes-1-4A-Boxed/dp/0321751043)
  * Synopsis: Multi volume books meant to cover all the different mathematics used to write algorithms. Volumes are separated based on math concept.
  * Opinion: Don't expect to read these back to back. Take it in parts and for topics that you are interested in. For example I found the section on hashing interesting when I was trying to understand it better.
* [Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)
  * Synopsis: Canonical Algorithmns teaching book.
  * Opinion: I have a personal affinity for this book due to its simplicity in format and diagrams. IMO it isn't too wordy like other books and gives me what I need to know quickly.
* [Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Dragon Book)](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811)
  * Synopsis: Provides information for building a compiler and the different features involved.
  * Opinion: Really loved this book in school. Gave me a good sense of compiler basics. Unfortunately it doesn't cover more advanced topics like type reification but it shouldn't be expected as starter book.

## Computer History

* [The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026OR3LM) - Observations by Eric S. Raymond of Linux development and Open Source projects in general while managing his own (i.e. fetchmail).  
* [Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World](https://www.amazon.com/Cult-of-Dead-Cow-Joseph-Menn-audiobook/dp/B07RX456JM/ref=zg_bs_3573_6?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=86XCT8CGTYH8X7H7KJ6S) 
  * Synopsis: Hacktivism where its followers are battling electoral misinformation, making personal data safer, and battling to keep technology a force for good instead of for surveillance and oppression.
  * Opinion: As a 90's kid of the nascent personal Internet this is very nostalgic for me. Great read if you want to get a sense of the hacking ethos at the time.
* [The Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670899763/acmorg-20) - Outlines Licklider's visionary dream of a "human-computer symbiosis" transforming the course of modern science and led to the development of the personal computer.
* [Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe](https://www.amazon.com/Turings-Cathedral-Origins-Digital-Universe/dp/1400075998)
  * Synopsis: A history of computation and the creation of the computer.
  * Opinion: Gave me a deep sense of the contribution that philosphy and mathemetics had on computers, and a new appreciation of its history.

## Software

### Design &amp; Architecture

* [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship-ebook/dp/B001GSTOAM)
